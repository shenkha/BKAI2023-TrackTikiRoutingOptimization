# BKAI2023-TrackTikiRoutingOptimization
- This repo contains the baseline, report slide and technical report for my SOICT HACKATHON in the Track Tiki: Routing Optimization. 
- The results in my report are totally different from what you may see in my code, as the main source code is unfortunately no longer available for public access.
- Our team achieved the Consolation prize with 100$.
